Requirements for Basic Authentication Middleware

HTTP Handler Function: The middleware should wrap an HTTP handler function to intercept requests.
Token Verification:
Extract the authentication token from the Authorization header (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <token>).
Validate the token (e.g., check if it matches a predefined token or secret key).
Handle different scenarios, such as:
Valid token: Allow the request to proceed to the next handler.
Missing token: Return a 401 Unauthorized response.
Invalid token: Return a 403 Forbidden response.
Configuration:

Define a configuration for the middleware, such as:
The expected authentication scheme (e.g., Bearer).
The valid token (this can be hardcoded for simplicity or loaded from environment variables for better security).
Response Handling:

Use the appropriate HTTP status codes:
200 OK for authorized requests.
401 Unauthorized for requests without an authentication token.
403 Forbidden for requests with an invalid token.
Logging:

Optionally, implement logging to record authentication attempts, both successful and unsuccessful.
Testing:

Write tests for the middleware to ensure it behaves as expected:
Test with valid tokens.
Test with missing tokens.
Test with invalid tokens.
Integration:

Integrate the middleware into your main application:
Create a simple server that uses the middleware to protect certain routes.
Ensure that some endpoints are publicly accessible while others require authentication.
Optional Enhancements
Token Generation:

Implement a simple token generation mechanism (e.g., using JWT) if you want to create tokens programmatically rather than hardcoding them.
Error Messages:

Provide informative error messages in the response body to indicate the reason for failure (e.g., "Token is missing" or "Invalid token").
Customizable Token Storage:

If expanding functionality, consider using a database or in-memory store to manage valid tokens.
Testing Framework:

Use a testing framework like Goâ€™s testing package or third-party libraries (like httptest) for writing unit tests and integration tests.
